## What is this repo for? 
This is my homework repository maintained for the Data Engineering course - #DataTalksCLub - DE Zoomcamp 
. https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp

## What we're working on?
We're working on building a platform to gather the data using Data Engineering principles. In the above course, we learn Python, Terraform, GCP, Prefect, GCP BigQuery, DBT, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka

## What data we're using in this course?
We're using the NYC taxi data - https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data

### What this Data for and why it's collected already by NYC govt?

1. New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission’s (TLC) has collected this data and derived some insights which were helpful to the businesses. 
2. Through the City’s Open Data portal, TLC’s trip data help businesses distinguish new business opportunities from saturated markets, encourage competition, and help investors follow trends in both new app transportation and the traditional car service and hail taxi markets
3. Using Data to Improve Mobility - in the disconnected and less-robust public transport available areas
4. NYC’s greatest economic challenges is the tremendous cost of congestion - especially in Midtown Manhattan
    a. using this informed data, City Council passed legislation to pause the growth in for-hire service while the City developed a long-term policy for managing congestion from for-hire vehicles
5. Using Data to Ensure Transportation Access for Passengers Who Use Wheelchairs
    a. by mid-2018 fewer than 200 of the more than 100,000 for-hire vehicles were wheelchair accessible, which is very sad :( 
    b. TLC regulations bridged the gap. All for-hire services in NYC must now provide wheelchair accessible service through one of two options, both of which TLC can easily monitor through data.
6. Using Data to Keep Unsafe Drivers off the Road
    a. Driving drowsy is as dangerous as driving drunk
    b. TLC passed regulations limiting drivers’ working hours and reviews troves of trip records to identify and penalize those drivers who continue to spend more time on the road than is safe for them or their passengers
    c. More powerful, though, is that TLC penalizes companies that continue to send trips to their drivers past the point of fatigue
    d. In 2018, fatalities involving NYC TLC drivers decreased by 50 percent.
7. Using Data for Driver Pay Protection
    a. Analyzing data we require from the companies revealed an overwhelmingly underpaid workforce, with 96% of drivers making less than the New York State minimum wage
    b. Companies are thriving and profiting in NYC
    c. To achieve greater balance, TLC passed a new pay standard - Rather than creating a minimum hourly wage, it establishes a pay floor for each trip
